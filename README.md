# EvdevExampleScripts
All files are written on a raspberry pi 2b in python and NEED the evdev Libary 

the command line statment i usede to install evdev is:- "sudo apt install python3-evdev"

I'm unable to create scripts, so yes I've probably used your code (sorry), if you recognise your code/snippes tell me if you want credit or for me to remove it.

for fun i modify scripts for all my devices

If it has INPUT-DONE  thats what it means all buttons wheels pucks leds ect are readable/changable in this script.

If it has OUTPUT-DONE that means inputs and outputs are working 

If it has USB-DONE    that means input, output and USB are working (this may need extra RPi's and/or Arduino's)
